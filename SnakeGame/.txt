There is a bug in the code when is collide is true where you set score = 0 , you should display it 0 also its not changing
 if (isCollide(snakeArr)) 
    {
        Score = 0;  
        scoreBox.innerHTML = "Score : " + Score; // add this line
        inputDir = {x:0 , y:0} ;
        alert("Game over , press any key to play again") ;
        snakeArr = [{x: 13, y: 15}];
        
    }



// we can use setInterval but its better animation ke waqt we use this method
window.requestAnimationFrame(main)
